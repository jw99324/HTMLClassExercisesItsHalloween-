    <h3>Welcome to my site.</h3>
    <h4>Please come in and stay awhile.</h4>

<p> I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
<p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

<h4>Product of the week</h4>
